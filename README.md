This folder contains the code and the report of the project "Machine Learning for Domain Name Classification in Network Traffic Analysis", done in the course "Machine Learning for Networking" @ Polytechnic of Turin.

In the project we got familiar with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
